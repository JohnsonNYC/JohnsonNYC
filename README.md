### 'Ello, I'm Johnson üëã

I'm a Software Engineer based out of New York City. Back in 2018, I graduated from Sryacuse University with my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. My curiosities in programming led me to attend a coding bootcamp where I learned fullstack development. My stack includes Javascript, ReactJS, and Ruby on Rails. 

Recently, I've obtained my AWS Cloud Practioner Ceritificate as I'm interested in eventually getting a specialized certificate in Machine Learning. Currently, I'm learning NodeJS and MongoDB to build out a task-manager application with full authentications using JWT.
